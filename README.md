My pronouns are they/them/he/him.

IRL I've been working with iOS for about a decade (christ). I currently work full time as a principal software engineer in the broadcasting industry. Huge advocate for automated testing and accessible experiences. I write code in my spare time as I don't get much of it at work these days!

Feel free to ask me about iOS, HLS, TDD, Objective-C, Swift and related topics. Can't promise I'll have any answers but I'm happy to be a more lively rubber duck.

I'm currently working on an app that gives me the space needed to learn more about Domain Driven Design, alongside all the fun app stuff I don't have time or reason to mess with at work. This will be closed source with open source components.
